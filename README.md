# vite-plugin-singlefile

This Vite build plugin allows you to _inline_ all JavaScript and CSS resources directly into the final `dist/index.html` file. By doing this, your _entire web app_ can be embedded and distributed as a single HTML file.

## Why?

Bundling your _entire_ site into one file certainly isn't recommended for most situations.

In particular, this is not a good idea, performance-wise, for a normal web site hosted on a web server.

However, this can be _very_ handy for _offline_ web applications-- apps bundled into a single HTML file that you can double-click and open directly in your web browser, no server needed. This might include utilities, expert system tools, documentation, demos, and other situations where you want the full power of a web browser, without the need for a Cordova or Electron wrapper or the pain of normal application installation.

## Limitations

Web applications running from a local file have some browser security limitations:

- No ability to access external domains -- no images, no API calls, etc.
- `<link />`, `<script>`, `<img>`, CSS `url()`, or similar HTML/CSS/JS features that expect to make a request for another file will not work. This plugin gets around that by bundling as many of these as possible into the single file output.
- No cookies. However, you can use `localStorage` and the newer experimental Persistent Storage APIs. You can also use the FileSystem API, with user permission.
- SPA routing requires using hash-based routes -- the web history API doesn't work for local files, and a web browser will not allow you to navigate between local HTML files.
- Any sourcemaps you generate will be useless, since this plugin bundles the compiled files after sourcemaps are generated. Turning off esbuild's minification in your vite config will at least ensure the code is legible when debugging.

Last but not least, this is a **single file** plugin. As in, it creates **one HTML file**. Hence the name. So, this **will not work** with multi-page apps. Please see issue #51 for details.

## Installation

```shell
npm install vite-plugin-singlefile --save-dev
```

or

```shell
yarn add vite-plugin-singlefile --dev
```

## How do I use it?

Here's an example `vite.config.ts` file using this plugin for a Vue.js app:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue"
import { viteSingleFile } from "vite-plugin-singlefile"

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [vue(), viteSingleFile()],
})
```

### Config

You can pass a configuration object to modify how this plugin works. The options are described below:

### useRecommendedBuildConfig

Defaults to `true`. This plugin will automatically adjust your vite configuration to allow assets to
be combined into a single file. To disable this:

```ts
viteSingleFile({ useRecommendedBuildConfig: false })
```

Refer to the `_useRecommendedBuildConfig` function in the `index.ts` file of this repository to see the
recommended configuration.

### removeViteModuleLoader

Defaults to `false`. Vite includes a function in your build to load other bundles. Since we're inlining
all bundles, you can use this option to have the bundle-loading function removed from your final build:

```ts
viteSingleFile({ removeViteModuleLoader: true })
```

### inlinePattern

Defaults to `[]`, which will inline all recognized JavaScript and CSS assets. You can provide a string
array of "glob" patterns to limit the inlining to certain assets. Any assets missed by your patterns will
generate a warning (same as any unrecognized assets).

### deleteInlinedFiles

Defaults to `true`, which deletes all inlined files that were inlined. A use case for turning this
to `false` would be if you would like sourcemaps to be generated so you can upload them to an error
tracking platform like Sentry.io.

### collapseNewlines

Defaults to `false`. `vite-plugin-singlefile` will inline assets in the `generateBundle` stage, during
which it is too late to run any code minification plugins; setting this to `true` will trim leading
and trailing newlines inserted while combining resources in a single file.

### Caveats

- `favicon` resources are not inlined by Vite, and this plugin doesn't do that either.
- Inlining of SVG isn't supported directly by Vite, so it isn't supported directly here either. You'll need to use something like `https://github.com/jpkleemans/vite-svg-loader`, or put your SVG directly into the template.
- There may be other situations where referenced files aren't inlined by Vite and aren't caught by this plugin either.
- This is my first Vite and first Rollup plugin. I have no idea what I'm doing. PRs welcome.
- This plugin uses dual packages to support both ESM and CommonJS users. This _should_ work automatically. Details:

## Contributing

- Please have PrettierJS installed so your IDE formatting doesn't overwrite the formatting in the source files
- Please clone [vite-plugin-singlefile-example](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile-example) in a sister folder and use it to test your modifications to this plugin before submitting a PR. (I'm happy to take PRs for it as well if you want to add more edge cases to test, such as a large third-party dependency. It's pretty barebones for now.)
- I wasn't able to persuade Jest to run on the bare source file, so it instead compiles and runs the CommonJS distribution file.
